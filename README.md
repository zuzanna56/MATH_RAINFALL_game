## Usage

After starting the game you are able to choose level of difficulty. Higher levels introduce more challenging equations and increase the speed of the falling balls.

At the top of the screen, a mathematical equation is displayed along with balls containing numbers falling from the top. Your goal is to catch the falling ball with the correct answer by moving the bucket left and right using the mouse.

You start the game with three lives. For each correct answer, you earn a point, hear a pleasant sound, and the color of the equation momentarily changes to green.

If your answer is wrong you lose one life which is indicated by disappearing heart and original sound.
